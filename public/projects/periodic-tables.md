# About the Project

Periodic Tables is a capstone project developed for the Thinkful Academy coding bootcamp, designed as a full-stack web application to assist restaurants in managing their reservations. The app allows hosts or hostesses to accept new reservations, search existing ones, and manage seating arrangements within the restaurant.

Developed to synthesize and apply concepts learned across the full stack of web development, the project was guided by specific user stories and assessed through a suite of end-to-end tests.

# Project Execution

Built on the PERN stack (Postgres, Express, React, Node), the project's backend prioritizes efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Leveraging PostgreSQL for its relational capabilities, Express for API construction, and Knex.js for SQL query building, the API is optimized to serve the exact data needs of the frontend with minimal overhead. 

Development began with the backend, ensuring the API's functionality was fully tested and operational before initiating frontend work.

The frontend employs Bootstrap for its UI, focusing on a lightweight and intuitive user experience, while React Router enhances the app's interactivity and seamless navigation.

This structured approach, driven by user stories and unit tests, facilitated a predictable and efficient development process.

# Project Results

The completion of Periodic Tables not only fulfilled the capstone project requirements of the Thinkful Academy but also demonstrated the practical application of the PERN stack in developing responsive web applications.

The project's acceptance highlighted the effective use of modern web technologies to meet specific user needs, while feedback on code quality and efficiency offered valuable insights for further refinement.

This hands-on experience underscored the importance of a methodical approach to web development, from understanding user requirements to implementing and refining a fully functional application.
