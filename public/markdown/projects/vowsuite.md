# About the Project

Vowsuite is a project in development aimed at providing a CRM platform, website builder, and multimedia hosting solution tailored for the wedding industry. The project seeks to streamline the management and digital showcase of wedding professionals through a unified platform. 

Currently, the focus is on building the foundational features that will enable users to efficiently manage their business operations and digital content.

# Project Execution

Backend operations are built on Prisma for object-relational mapping with a MySQL database, enhancing data management. TypeScript is chosen for its type safety features, alongside zod for schema validation and react-hook-form for form handling, ensuring data integrity and user input validation.

Next.js serves as the full-stack framework, enabling dynamic server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO.

For the frontend, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, sonner, and radix-ui are integrated for customizable UI components and theme support. File management is addressed with UploadThing, facilitating file uploads in line with Next.js' capabilities.

Vowsuite incorporates Clerk for authentication, supporting secure access control within agencies. Automated CI/CD is implemented through Vercel and GitHub Actions, streamlining deployment and maintenance.
