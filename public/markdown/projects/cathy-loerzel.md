# About the Project

Cathy Loerzel approached me to develop her personal website ahead of her first book release, setting a tight deadline to ensure the site was live for the launch. By employing a kanban board and rigorous project management practices in collaboration with a graphic designer, we ensured the project's timely delivery.

The objective was to create a visually appealing site that not only highlighted Cathy's work but also allowed her to independently update her content through a custom CMS, focusing on user-friendliness and autonomy.

# Project Execution

The project kicked off with the frontend design, approved by Cathy, leading to the development of a custom API using Node.js and a PostgreSQL database for data handling. I then constructed a CMS dashboard with React and TypeScript, enabling Cathy to self-manage her website's content. The relational database architecture allowed for extensive customization of blog posts, events, categories, and tags, facilitating significant structural changes without further coding.

Emphasis on code organization and best practices was paramount to facilitate future maintenance. Security measures, including Auth0 authentication and environment variables, safeguarded access and data integrity, allowing for a safe, extendable, and maintainable codebase.

Since its launch, CathyLoerzel.com has been operational for three years with minimal disruptions, supporting Cathy's professional endeavors and content updates without direct developer intervention. The relational database design empowers Cathy to modify the site structure significantly—be it through new blog categories or tags—enhancing the site’s navigability and relevance.

The project's success can be attributed to diligent planning, robust security measures, and a client-focused approach.
