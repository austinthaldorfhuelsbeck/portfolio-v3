# About the Project

The inception of Vowsuite stemmed from a desire to explore the capabilities of combining various technologies into a cohesive video delivery platform. As a proof of concept, Vowsuite was envisioned to test the integration of video uploading, organization, and delivery through branded galleries. This project not only served as a technological exploration but also as a stepping stone towards the development of a more refined version utilizing next-generation technologies.

The primary challenge was to establish a seamless workflow between the backend and frontend components, ensuring efficient video management and an aesthetic delivery system. The use of Node.js with Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Firebase for the backend, alongside React with styled components and the context API on the frontend, provided a robust foundation for this video delivery platform.

# Project Execution

Development commenced with the backend setup using Node.js and Express to handle API requests, MongoDB for database management, and Firebase for secure video storage. The backend's architecture was designed for efficient data retrieval, catering to the dynamic needs of video content management.

On the frontend, React's modular nature, complemented by styled components and the context API, allowed for dynamic content updates, ensuring the interface remained responsive and intuitive.
A significant focus was placed on the user interface design, aiming to create a simple yet effective gallery editor and public gallery view.

The project was divided into two main repositories, `vs-server` for the backend and `vs-client` for the frontend, simplifying the development process and allowing for independent scaling. Environment variables were used to bridge the two, ensuring a secure and modular configuration.

# Project Results

Vowsuite's proof of concept demonstrated the feasibility of creating a video delivery platform that integrates various technologies into a seamless workflow. While authentication was not implemented, the project successfully showcased video uploading, gallery organization, and aesthetic public gallery delivery.
