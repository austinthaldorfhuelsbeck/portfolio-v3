# Building in Public

Learning to code opens up a lot of creative possibilities. For me, I noticed early into my self-taught journey that the possibility of starting my own business was opening up. This is amazing, I thought, I can do anything I can imagine and I can do it all by myself.

But actually, there is a lot of value in involving potential customers early in the development process. Maybe I don't have to lock myself in a dark closet until the project is making me money?

The reality is, building in public offers a transparent way to develop products, creating a stronger connection with users, and I think it might end up helping me, too.

## Why Build in Public?

Building in public means sharing your development process openly. This approach helps in getting valuable feedback early on, allowing you to focus on what really matters to your users. It's not a lot of fun to work for weeks developing a feature only to end up creating a different feature not long after that replaces the first feature. If you think your app does Thing A really well, but then when people start using it, they mostly use it for Thing B that you added in for fun, you're going to want to have to retrace your steps as little as possible in order to give the customers what they actually want.

* **Feedback**: Early and direct input from potential users.
* **Focus**: Prioritize features that add real value.
* **Transparency**: Builds trust with your audience.

## Community and Collaboration

After five years, it's clear to me that coding thrives on community support. This is probably the only industry where so many tools are open and available for free, and there's a shared desire to help projects succeed. Even if a project is not open source, that doesn't mean there can't be community involvement.

## Introducing Vowsuite

I'm using my blog and social media to build Vowsuite publicly. It's a CRM platform and website builder for wedding industry professionals, inspired by my own experience in wedding videography. High hosting costs for video galleries highlighted a need for a better solution.

### Vowsuite Features:

* **Affordable hosting**: For video and photo galleries.
* **Customizable**: Tailored for wedding professionals.

Though I don't expect much feedback due to a small following, sharing the journey will still help me organize and reflect on my thoughts, and it might inspire contribution or feedback.

### Future Directions

The direction of Vowsuite, whether it becomes a business or remains a niche tool, is still undecided. The challenge is to make it accessible without incurring significant costs. My primary focus right away is to develop Vowsuite to a point where I can switch to using it full-time for my wedding videography business.

## I'm interested in your thoughts:

* Have you built in public before?
* Any lessons learned or advice to share?
* Any cautionary tales for software entrepreneurs?

Thank you for reading. Stay tuned for updates, including technical details and development insights as development progresses.

Let's navigate this journey together, learning and building as we go.
