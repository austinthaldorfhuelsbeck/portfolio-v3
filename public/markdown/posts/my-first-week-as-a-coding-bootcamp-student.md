My initial days at Thinkful’s coding bootcamp felt overwhelming. The vast amount of knowledge to be acquired in a seemingly short time framed a daunting challenge. Yet, the key lies in tackling one small piece at a time.

Establishing a solid foundation during the first week was crucial. This involved understanding the process is akin to building an application or website—one step at a time.

The initial week also involves essential preparations: identifying the tools for coding, figuring out how to connect with classmates or instructors, and setting up a conducive learning environment. Recognizing the most fundamental skills is the first step towards building a comprehensive knowledge base.

## Make a plan

Planning your learning trajectory is equally important. Skills and concepts in development build on each other, making it essential to know your next step. Having a roadmap can significantly ease this process.

While the curriculum guides you through the concepts, applying them in projects and allowing your creativity to flourish can solidify your understanding. For instance, setting a goal to develop a portfolio of working projects by the end of the course can serve as a motivating roadmap.

## Make a to-do list

Such a portfolio, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is a testament to the journey of learning and development, managed with GitHub, and presented to the world via the Internet. Here's a breakdown of the steps needed to realize this goal:

- Acquire enough coding knowledge to code a portfolio on my local machine.
- Incorporate version control with Git.
- Progress from project initiation to completion by testing and revising the code.
- Publish the site online for public access.

While the task of putting a portfolio online may seem extensive at first glance, breaking it down into manageable tasks provides a clear starting point.

## Understand the technology

In the first week, I discovered the role of JavaScript in adding interactivity to websites. This inspired me to envision a portfolio with engaging animations and user interactivity, because I had already created a portfolio with HTML/CSS and I could see what it was missing. Start building first, and when you reach a point where you can't do what you want to do, pause to learn the technology that will allow you to do it.

With this knowledge, I was able to further expand on my first bullet point from above:

- Start with mastering the basics of HTML and CSS.
- Use these tools to design and develop the initial version of the site.
- Determine the JavaScript necessary to enhance the site's interactivity and appeal.
- Integrate the necessary JavaScript components.

## Stay flexible

This plan is still not set in stone; it's adaptable based on new learning and insights gained along the way. What matters most is taking the initiative and progressing step by step, embodying the principles of software development in your work.
