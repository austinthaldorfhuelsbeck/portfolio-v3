Choosing the right frontend framework for a new side project or freelance project is a big moment in the development process. When you nail it, you're off to the races and it's a lot of coding and having fun from there.
When you mess up and pick the wrong framework and don't realize it until later, you end up wasting a ton of time on forums and documentation and rewriting all your code anyway and either break your keyboard in the process or lose sleep for the next month questioning your identity.

Let's dive into some considerations and examples to guide you through this decision and spare you the ensuing expenses.

## Do you even need a framework?
First off, it's essential to recognize the power of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript on their own. CSS and HTML are pretty powerful nowadays and you don't need to use a framework in many cases, you can accomplish what you want with a little bit of vanilla JavaScript. Of course a simple portfolio website or a landing page don't always need a framework, but even an online store or blog can be elegantly executed using just HTML and CSS, with a bit of JavaScript to add interactivity such as a mobile menu toggle or modal windows and fetch data.

Here's a few more examples of sites you could build without a framework:
- Interactive gallery/slideshow
- Online learning platform with quizzes
- Interactive event invitation page
- Budget tracker that visualizes financial health
- Pick your favorite: snake, tetris, or pong
- Multi page survey with input validation and visualized results
- Custom portfolio template you can sell

However, for more dynamic applications that require a reactive user interface, a JavaScript framework or library can be necessary. But even if you spend the time to learn a framework like React, there are still many ways to style an app and to interact with data, and there are even frameworks built on top of React.
The key question to ask is:

## What is your app trying to accomplish?

Understanding your app's primary function and its target audience is crucial. I bet your target audience includes cell phone users.

If your app is intended primarily for mobile users, maybe you just want to develop a mobile app? It's important not to overthink the problem.

There are a few viable options for building mobile apps.
React Native is great if you're already familiar with React and want to leverage that knowledge across platforms, but there are other options like Flutter if you need great performance and don't want to use JavaScript, and SwiftUI if you are already invested in Swift or want to develop for the App Store specifically.

Maybe you decide you need to develop a mobile app and a web app, and if you identify that early, and you like React, you can just go ahead and get started with React and React Native from the jump.

### Responsiveness

Responsive web apps are just 100% the norm. If you're developing a web app, figure out how to make it responsive.
Having experimented with styled components, Bootstrap, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS, I've found Tailwind to be exceptionally efficient, although it may not suit everyone's taste or project requirements. For a bigger project, you're probably going to want to write with one of these rather than pure CSS -- it would just get tedious.

## So what does it do?

The next consideration is how your app will interact with data.
Will your app consume data from an existing API, or will you need to build a custom API? For projects interfacing with APIs, the choice of framework can significantly affect development experience and performance of the final product.

### Full-stack frameworks rock

When your app requires a custom API, a full-stack framework like Next.js offers a streamlined approach to building responsive web applications that incorporate server-side rendering and static site generation. This is particularly useful for apps that involve user-generated content, form submissions, or data uploads.

Actually there are a lot of benefits to Next.js but at the end of the day, it is just my personal preference as a developer who began with JavaScript and Node.js and who likes React.
Honestly, if you already know another language well, your time may be better spent learning that language's most popular and supported framework instead.

- **Ruby:** Ruby on Rails
- **Python**: Django
- **PHP:** Laravel
- **C#:** ASP.NET Core
- **Java:** Spring Boot / Play Framework

But if you don't know any of those languages and you're interested in frontend development... you should probably just learn a JavaScript framework. JavaScript is really important to know as a frontend developer and it will never go out of style.

### I don't think I need all that

In cases where your app interfaces directly with third-party APIs, you can use a JavaScript framework to make it capable of more cool stuff.
The decision between using React or other frameworks like Angular or Vue.js which can depend on personal preference, the complexity of the state management, and the specific requirements of the API integration.

#### React
- **Flexibility and Ecosystem:** React's library-centric approach make it best for projects where the API integration involves a unique or complex data flow that doesn't fit neatly into a conventional model. You will end up with a ton of dependencies but it's important to know you can use React for handling API requests, caching, and state management according to the project's specific needs.
- **Component Reusability:** React's component-based architecture allows for efficient reuse of UI components. This can be particularly beneficial for APIs that deliver complex, nested data structures that need to be displayed in multiple, distinct views.

#### Angular
- **Comprehensive Framework:** Angular is a full-fledged framework with a bunch of batteries in the box. It's really great if you have a lot of complex forms and need to perform a ton of CRUD operations.
- **Reactive Programming:** RxJS for handling asynchronous operations is great for interacting with APIs in a highly dynamic manner. Check it out if the API integration involves real-time data streaming or complex chains of asynchronous operations.

#### Vue.js
- **Simplicity and Progressive Adoption:** For applications that interface with APIs in a straightforward manner—such as simple fetch requests and data display—Vue's approachable syntax and progressive nature make it a strong candidate. It allows developers to start small and scale up as needed.
- **Custom Directives:** If the API requires a lot of custom client-side logic to transform data for display or to integrate reactive data properties seamlessly, Vue provides a flexible toolset to achieve these goals with minimal boilerplate.

## Static (Typing) Shock

As projects become more complex, introducing TypeScript can enhance type safety and improve your own development experience in VSCode. If you're working with JavaScript already, show a little self-love and learn TypeScript.

## Balance and tradeoffs

Ultimately, the choice of technologies often comes down to personal preference and familiarity. I have really enjoyed using Next.js with TypeScript and tailwind and so I tend to want to develop projects that use them well.
However, it's important to remain open-minded. Every technology has something it excels at and something it sucks at. They are still working on developing the perfect programming language and until then, we will have to be aware of this balance.
